# An NVDA case study done for I Know First
During my internship at I Know First, I faced a significant challenge: predicting the stock movement of NVIDIA (NVDA). Tasked with both qualitative and quantitative analysis, I decided to take a creative leap by developing a sophisticated machine learning model to tackle the problem.
One of the biggest challenges I faced was the startup culture at I Know First, which meant being "plunged into the deep end" with minimal guidance. This required me to quickly learn and apply new techniques independently. I leveraged yfinance to gather historical data and used Python for processing and analysis. I engineered new features and applied Ridge regression to predict future stock prices, blending traditional analysis with advanced machine learning.
Managing the large dataset and ensuring the model's accuracy were significant hurdles. I overcame these by breaking the problem into manageable steps and iteratively refining my approach. This experience pushed me out of my comfort zone and ultimately built my confidence in handling large, independent projects.
